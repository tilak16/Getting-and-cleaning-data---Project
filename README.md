# Getting-and-cleaning-data---Project
Project related materials for Getting cleaning data

This file summarizes how the script works and the dependencies to get it to work. 
There are two files that are essential to get tidy data. 
	1. run_analysis.R - this is the R script that needs to be run on the data to tidy it up
	2. CodeBook.md - This is a file that explains in english the different transformations done by the R script to tidy the data
The results of the R script is available in a different file that is uploaded separately.
Libraries
The script needs two packages installed. The data.table package and the plyr package. Please ensure that these packages are downloaded and installed before running the script.
Location of script
The script is titled run_analysis.R and is sourced from the directory that that data is stored in. The script should be located in the directory titled "UCI HAR Dataset" which is the top most directory for the dataset. Further, you may need to change the path of the working directory appropriately. This needs to be done on lines 7, 11 and 19 of the script. Once these setwd commands are renamed to the correct path the code will be able to process the data.
Variable description
The variables have the same names as used in the raw data and the variable names are copied from the original readme file. Please note that we have calculate the average of the mean() variables and the average of the std() (i.e. standard deviation) variables in our processing.
Variable names
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

The actual values in the output file are the average of the mean(mean()) and average of the standard deviation(std()) for each subject doing each activity.
